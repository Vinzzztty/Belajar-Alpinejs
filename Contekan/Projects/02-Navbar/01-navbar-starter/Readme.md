1.Create a responsive navigation bar. The menu items should be block while on mobile viewpoint & inline/inline-block on large display.
2.Add hamburger icons: 1 for open, 1 for close.
3.Hamburger icons should be only visible on mobile display.
4.Menu items should be hidden in mobile display.
5.When we click the 'open' icon, the menu items will be visible along with the 'close' icon. The 'open' icon will be hidden.
#Hint: we can achieve it by using click event to add or remove some classes that will make the elements visible/hidden or simply we can use the x-show directive
