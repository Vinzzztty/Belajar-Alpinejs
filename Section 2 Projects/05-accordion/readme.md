1. Create a variable and give that a value.
2. Change the value based on which accordion gets clicked.
3. If the value matched on that particular accordion increase the height of that accordion content, otherwise make that accordion content a height of 0 to make it invisible.
4. You can use the x-ref to get the height of a particular element of HTML by using scrollHeight property of javascript.
